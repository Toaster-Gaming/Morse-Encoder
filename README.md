# Morse-Encoder
This project was made as a test, for fun! If you decide to go out of your way and be like, "Hey! I'm not gonna use a boring morse encoder website! I'm gonna use a ameuter's morse encoder!"
This project is exactly that. This morse encoder is WIP, so do not expect it to work the way you think it is going to be.
Don't trust this project too much, because it could crash easily, and it isn't really reliable. Thank you for taking your time to read this boring README.exe file.
Thanks!
